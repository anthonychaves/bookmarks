App server(configure entitymanager) -> spring(get entitymanager from jndi?) -> spring(inject entitymanager into beans?)
Where does persistence.xml fit into this?

Glassfish - configure connection pool, data source
Glassfish - alias data source in sun*....xml
Spring - look up data source via aliased name?  probably not because...
persistence.xml - knows data source name
Spring - just use EntityManager based on persistence unit defined in persistence.xml


git - get last commit details command?
git log --summary -1

OpenJPA - how do we load/update schema based on entity definitions?
- with the MappingTool and its Ant task!

Set up sun-web.xml with persistence unit and persistence context refs.  Use Spring PersistenceAnnotationBeanPostProcessor and reference the contexts defined in sun-web.xml

Blog entry: what's the difference between Spring EntityManager subclass and GlassFish EntityManager implementation and management?  Spring provides a thread-safe subclass or wrapper. How does GlassFish do it?  Is it thread safe?
