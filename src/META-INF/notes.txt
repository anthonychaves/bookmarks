App server(configure entitymanager) -> spring(get entitymanager from jndi?) -> spring(inject entitymanager into beans?)
Where does persistence.xml fit into this?

Glassfish - configure connection pool, data source
Glassfish - alias data source in sun*....xml
Spring - look up data source via aliased name?  probably not because...
persistence.xml - knows data source name
Spring - just use EntityManager based on persistence unit defined in persistence.xml

git - get last commit details command?
git log --summary -1

Blog entry: what's the difference between Spring EntityManager subclass and GlassFish EntityManager implementation and management?  Spring provides a thread-safe subclass or wrapper. How does GlassFish do it?  Is it thread safe?

Is openid.identity permanent?  Does this token change?  Is it ok to use this as unique user id in webapp? - This is not permanent.  

How do we open a new window for authentication instead of using a redirect?

ConsumerManager must be static or singleton - how do we route back to the same one in a cluster?

REST-like api: add servlet filter to look up user and insert into session based on token provided in api call.  return json or xml instead of forwarding to jsp

How do we map views <-> xml responses?

Revisit @PersistenceUnit vs. @PersistenceContext annotations
- JTA transactions let us use CMT.  CMT in Spring is invasive to programming model, moreso than UserTransaction API.  
- JTA transactions also let us inject an EntityManager into a bean taken from the current thread.  EntityManager has a cache associated with it.  EntityManager and its cache hang around only for the duration of the transaction.  
- Extended transaction scope is good for stateful session beans - the EntityManager and its cache hang around for the duration of a method spanning business process.  
- So, we're left with a cache that's useful for one thread of execution inside a JTA transaction.  We need a database hit for each EntityManager persistence context cache miss.  We have an empty cache for each thread.  This prevents us from getting stale data since we get it right from the database for every thread.
- But we have to hit the database for each object in each thread.  Doesn't this seem wasteful?
- Shared cache!  
- Can we switch to Hibernate as our JPA provider and slip ehcache in to serve as the shared cache?
- How do we handle evictions?  Is this only a problem when more than one application access our database?

How do I revert a file to its pre-edit state with git?  I do not want to check in a file.  Bad edit.  solution: git checkout -- <files>

@GeneratedValue id won't merge: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OPENJPA-673

UUID is 128 bits or 2^128.  hex encoded string: each character is 2^4. 16 hex char representation of the 64 most or least sig bits of a UUID is 2^64 because each char is half a byte.

Done 2010-01-10-ish - Login from cookie in servlet filter
Done 2010-01-17 - Page title, bookmark tags
Done 2010-01-18 - Deleting a bookmark has a bug but I'm so tired I can't see the screen anymore to fix it...
Session timeout - not really an issue.  Sessions timeouts are configured in the app server. Why did I put this on the list?
Nested sessions - again, why is this on the list?
Success page for adding a bookmark from the bookmarklet.
Done 2010-01-30 - Real tags using Redis
2010-01-31 - Had to change deployment to Tomcat because MappingJackson* doesn't work at all in Glassfish.  Tremendous waste of time.  
2010-01-31 - I guess there's nothing to do for this item - Cleanup Mysql data source stuff and apache commons dbcp config
